The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a certain amount,determined by a "shift" value.
In this task, I created a program that allows users to input a message and a shift value, and then encrypts or decrypts the message using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. 
Algorithm implementationðŸ”¢

Here's an example of how the program works: if the user inputs the message "HELLO" and a shift value of 2, the program would encrypt the message to "KHOOR". 
To decrypt the message, the user can input the encrypted message and a negative shift value of -2, and the program would correctly output "HELLO". ðŸ”‘ðŸ’¡
